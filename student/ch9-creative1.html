<center><h2>Plant Physiology Q/A</h2></center>

<center><h3>[Answer Any 3/7]</h3></center>

<center><h4>Total Time: 60 Minutes | Total Marks: 30</h4></center>

<p> <b>Q 1</b></p>

<p>A 6-Carbon compound converts into 3-Carbon organic compound through different sequential steps. This 3-carbon organic acid can be oxidized into 2 ways according to organism.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Write the full form of NADP</li>
	<li>What do you understand by oxidative phosphorilation?</li>
	<li>Write the name of the enzymes used for creating the above mentioned 3-Carbon compound</li>
	<li>Based on organism, the 3-Carbon compound from above can produce energies of different amount. Explain this statement.</li>
</ol>

<p> <b>Q 2</b></p>

<div class="caption">Stomata</div>

<ol>
	<li>What do you mean by plasmolysis?</li>
	<li>What do you mean by symbiosis?</li>
	<li>The action of 'P' region is controlled by 'Q' - Explain this statement</li>
	<li>Write the importance of 'P' region in producing food in plants</li>
</ol>

<p> <b>Q 3</b></p>

<p>While giving lecture on Plant Biology, the teacher was mentioning to the students about the process of plant water excretion. He basically said that plants can excrete water in mainly 2 ways, one is through evaporation and the other through actual liquid droplets.</p>

<ol>
	<li>What do you mean by double fertilization?</li>
	<li>How does semi-conservative replication take place?</li>
	<li>Draw a labelled diagram of the above mentioned organ that facilitates a plant to excrete water through evaporation</li>
	<li>Compare between the 2 organs mentioned in the stem</li>
</ol>

<p> <b>Q 4</b></p>

<p>Category A: Sugarcane, Maize</p>
<p>Category B: Mango, Jackfruit</p>

<ol>
	<li>What do you understand by limiting factor?</li>
	<li>Why does mineral salt absorption normally occur through active process/require energy?</li>
	<li>Write the process of food production of category A plants</li>
	<li>Write the differences between Category A and Category B plants</li>
</ol>


<p> <b>Q 5 (Q - 15)</b></p>

<div class="caption">2 separate processes</div>

<ol>
	<li>What do you mean by plasmolysis?</li>
	<li>What do you understand by respiration rate?</li>
	<li>Write the amount of ATP produced in a chart according to the process on Picture M</li>
	<li>Analyze the process between picture M and N</li>
</ol>


<p> <b>Q 6 (q-32)</b></p>

<p>A and B are two pathways in green plants through which Carbon is reduced. It is also evident that, X can not be created from only B pathway without the completion of A pathway. The reaction is as follows;</p>

<p> X --&gt; 2CH<sub>3</sub>-CO-COOH + 2Y + 2Z (Here Z is a co-enzyme)</p>

<ol>
	<li>What do you mean by photorespiration?</li>
	<li>Prove that water is a must for light phase in photosynthesis</li>
	<li>Write about the dependence of B on A</li>
	<li>Write about the process of creation of Z from the stem.</li>
</ol>


<p><b>Q 7 (q - 61)</b></p>

<p>Heat dissipation is related to a phenomenon which creates bridge between sunlight and life.</p>

<ol>
	<li>What do you understand by inactive absorption?</li>
	<li>Describe shortly about Donan Equilibrium</li>
	<li>Why is the process of heat disspiation different in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organism?</li>
	<li>Both by-product and main-product of photosynthesis plays an important role in conserving environment and maintaining environment equilibrium</li>
</ol>
