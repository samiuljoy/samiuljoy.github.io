<p>There's some things that I need to figure out for planning ahead and do more proper research on subjects. Plans for the future projects mainly includes embedded systems and learning to use them for something worthwhile. What I'm planning to do are;</p>

<h3>Need a Raspberry pi</h3>

<p>I need a raspberry pi. Reasons include using it as an arm based small computer to carry on daily life activities, or what people usually do on a computer. Besides that, I also plan on using raspberry pi as a irc server. Thought this would be a very nice idea, where people close to me can chat on a protocol from early 1950's with up to date encryption. Whats app is a facade, and I'm only using it because of circumstantial reasons. Worst of all, it is owned by facebook/meta corporate company where every bit of code is closed sourced. No wonder what they are collecting behind our backs.</p>

<h3>Need a Arduino board</h3>

<div class="caption">Arduino Uno</div>

<p>I'm planning to get a Arduino uno board or something alike. Plans for arduino includes;</p>

<ul class="ull">
	<li>Automatic watering system for gardens and fields</li>
	<li>Automatic water system for house-hold water containers</li>
</ul>

<p>And if I'm successful with these projects, I'll try to go on commercial market place and sell these for real. All I now need is some proper utilization of time and vigorous experimentation.</p>

<p>Aside from these, there's also academic plans, household plans and whatnot. Not everything can be shared on the internet now, can it?</p>

<p>If you're interested to assist me in any way possible for these above projects, then I would be very delighted and would love to get in touch with you regarding these projects. You can contact me through the <a href="../about.html" rel="nofollow">about</a> page.</p>

<p>Hope you had fun reading this small post.</p>
