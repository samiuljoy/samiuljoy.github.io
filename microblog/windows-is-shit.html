<center><h2>Windows=shit</h2></center>

<div class='date'></div>
<p>I've recently installed windows 10 on my desktop ssd because of academic reasons and also because no one in the university among the teacher of our department knows how to even use linux. Which is really unfortunate, because I use linux on a daily basis, and am quite comfortable with it. Applications such as vim, the terminal and other linux applications are very good and efficient and far superior compared to windows applications. Although they are considerably more complicated and tough to use for the end user. Anyway, so after installing windows, I installed some applications, such as the mendley referencing manager and microsoft office for academic reasons.</p>


<h2>Initial Thoughts on windows</h2>

<p>Initially I thought, well it works, it hasn't showed any anomalies and it seemed to be working just fine. I was okay with it initially, however after going online in 10 minutes, it started to go crazy, it started to automatically update and the computer with it's limited 4GB of ram, started to get a little bit slow. Then windows decided to show some really awful, disgusting, obscene news on the start menu, which took me by surprise, and I quickly googled on how to stop windows news from showing news to the start menu. Then edge would open randomly. I didn't like edge so I decided to download google chrome web browser, and when downloading chrome, edge showed a banner on bing saying you don't need chrome. That I found intrusive.</p>


<h2>Thoughts After The Update</h2>

<p>After the windows update, windows got a lot slower and laggy. It started to lag frequently and would completely hang for no reason. The other day I was practicing my typing on <a href="https://monkeytype.com" rel="nofollow">monkeytype</a> and edge first started to hang and then the whole windows hanged. This was really unexpected. What if instead of practicing typing, I was doing my thesis work, and windows decides to randomly hang! That would be really uncomfortable and frustrating. This had happened to me multiple times though.</p>


<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I've ditched using windows 7 when it was 2015/2016 for no reason other than  just to try out linux. I've first tried/started with ubuntu and moved from there and used not too many linux distro's. Most of them were based off on debian, I've probably used 3 distros so far, and I'm a regular user of debian now. I never would've switched to windows if it not were for these teachers incompetence of not knowing how to use linux. After this catastrophic experience, I hate windows, not that I hated it before, but I hate it more now.</p>
