SETKEYCODES(8)                                           System Manager's Manual                                           SETKEYCODES(8)

NAME
       setkeycodes - load kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table entries

SYNOPSIS
       setkeycodes scancode keycode ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  setkeycodes command reads its arguments two at a time, each pair of arguments consisting of a scancode (given in hexadecimal)
       and a keycode (given in decimal). For each such pair, it tells the kernel keyboard driver to map the  specified  scancode  to  the
       specified keycode.

       This command is useful only for people with slightly unusual keyboards, that have a few keys which produce scancodes that the ker‚Äê
       nel does not recognize.

THEORY
       The usual PC keyboard produces a series of scancodes for each key press and key release. (Scancodes are shown by showkey  -s,  see
       showkey(1)  )  The  kernel  parses  this  stream of scancodes, and converts it to a stream of keycodes (key press/release events).
       (Keycodes are shown by showkey.)  Apart from a few scancodes with special meaning, and apart from the  sequence  produced  by  the
       Pause  key,  and  apart from shiftstate related scancodes, and apart from the key up/down bit, the stream of scancodes consists of
       unescaped scancodes xx (7 bits) and escaped scancodes e0 xx (8+7 bits).  To these scancodes or  scancode  pairs,  a  corresponding
       keycode  can  be assigned (in the range 1-127).  For example, if you have a Macro key that produces e0 6f according to showkey(1),
       the command
              setkeycodes e06f 112
       will assign the keycode 112 to it, and then loadkeys(1) can be used to define the function of this key.

       Some older kernels might hardwire a low scancode range to the equivalent keycodes; setkeycodes will fail when  you  try  to  remap
       these.
