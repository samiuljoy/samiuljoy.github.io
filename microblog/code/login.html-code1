# What I'm planning to do here is that, create a useradd script which allows a user to add themselves by puting in their names
# and their password. This will save the username::password to a file called mango.txt and prompt at each login by running
# the login.sh script If username already exists, notifies the user that a user with the same name exits, else add 
# the new user along with a password. The password is saved in a md5sum form.
